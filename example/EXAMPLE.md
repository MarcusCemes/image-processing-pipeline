# An example Responsive Image Builder export

The export contains the pictures obtained with RIB using the default configuration. The standard-sized WebP image is only 134KB! That's roughly a 25% reduction in size and bandwidth compared to its identical JPEG twin.

This is the kind of reduction that you can expect from WebP while maintaining the same or slightly superior quality. By playing with the encoding settings, you could drive those file-sizes down even further.

See for your self! The most noticeable degradation of quality is the chromatic noise that starts to appear on the black road.

It's not magic. A file just 3% the size of it's source has considerably less data, but RIB's goal is not sorcery, it's making your pages load faster, and saving data where it's not needed.
