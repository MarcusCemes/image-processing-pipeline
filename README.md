## About The Project

<div align="center">
  <img width="600" alt="Product screenshot" src="https://gistcdn.githack.com/MarcusCemes/9b4a3bbfefdae55e435d5fc98d3df062/raw/10eb7d1f30030b0aaf0bf57a891a7b44acf8a06a/responsive-image-builder-demo-2.svg" alt="An example of usage">
</div>

Responsive Image Builder is a CLI tool to help you automate your image build process. It does this with speed and quality in mind, to give your end-user the best possible experience.

### Built With

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (TypeScript)
- [libvips](https://github.com/libvips/libvips) (sharp)

## Motivation

A lighter web is now more important than ever, with cloud computing taking off and their ridiculous bandwidth costs! Your website's images can be the largest source of your outgoing bandwidth, incurring significant costs if not done correctly. Users will thank you for not draining their phone's battery and internet allowance.
