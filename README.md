## Why

Webpack... Angular... React... PHP... Cloudflare... So many solutions for serving images, some terrible, some paid. What if you just want to serve modern [WebP](https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/) images with srcset optimization, lazy-loading (with low-quality placeholder) and a fallback codec for [browsers that are late to the party](https://caniuse.com/#feat=webp) (ahem Safari, Firefox, Edge, ...)?

<p align="center">Is that really too much to ask?</p>

<p align="center"><sub>üéâ Firefox 65 and Edge 18 finally added support for WebP! Global support is now at 74.78% as of March 2019.</sub></p>

**So what does this do?** This is my homemade solution for building responsive Lanczos3 downscaled WebP images *intelligently*, while making it possible to implement cache-busting (all images are known during build) with the assurance of no duplicate images, therefore no wasted space. Fallback codecs are also generated for incompatible browsers, and optimized aggressively (PNG, JPEG, SVG and GIF supported). Without further configuration, this will create 8 web-optimized images (4 sizes, 2 codecs) from a very high quality source image by default. [See the result](example/) for yourself.

  </a>
  <br>
  <sub>This is the ideal <i>flow</i> that RIB aims to achieve, from dev to client</sub>
  <br>
</p>

Each image's exports are calculated at build-time, and a *manifest.json* file is created with all exported images and their available sizes. It's then up to the client to implement logic to fetch the best image. I have included [example](extra/) usages for Vanilla Javascript, React and Angular 2+, although bear in mind that they are a proof of concept and may not work with the latest *manifest.json* structure.

RIB can be used as a pipeline during the build process, piping all images from one folder into another, with options to preserve or flatten the directory structure, merge with existing files, read and consolidate several input paths, etc. Simply run the Node.js module or CLI tool to update the exports. The goal is to create a universal, simple export folder and manifest file. This can be your final destination that you upload through FTP or just a pipe in your cache-busting deployment build-chain.


## Getting started

### Prerequisites

RIB is very easy to get up and running. It requires an installation of Node.js, if you're a Web Developer than it is extremely likely you are using Node.js and NPM already. A vast majority of web tools rely on it.

<details><summary><b>Node.js installation instructions (click me)</b></summary>
<p>

### Node.js installation

#### <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5f/Windows_logo_-_2012.svg" alt="drawing" height="12"/>  Windows
You can download an installer from the [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) website, or if you are more advanced you can choose to use [NVM](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows) (node version manager) for Windows to mange your installation, allowing you to hot-swap versions.

#### <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Apple_logo_black.svg" alt="drawing" height="12"/>  macOS
You can download an installer from the [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) website, or if you are more advanced you can choose to use [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) (node version manager) to mange your installation, allowing you to hot-swap versions.

<p align="center"><sub>Node.js can also be installed with <a href="https://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a>, it avoids having to use <i>sudo</i></sub></p>

You guys know what you're doing. You're playing with big boy stuff. Here's a script to help you get started:


```bash
# Install NVM
$ curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.34.0/install.sh | bash

# RESTART TERMINAL

# Install the latest version of node
$ nvm install node
$ nvm use node

# Install responsive-image-builder
$ npm i -g --production responsive-image-builder
```

<b>RIB is a big boy</b>
<br>
SHARP is around ~90MB, and this project depends on it. You can always remove RIB when you're done.
<br>
<sub>SHARP is the Node.js wrapper around the libvips image processing library</sub>
</p>

There are two ways to install RIB, as a global CLI tool, or as a local Node.js module that can be imported and executed as a Javascript function.

### üåç Global installation (CLI usage)

Open up a terminal session and execute:
```bash
$ npm install --global --production responsive-image-builder
```
This installs RIB globally on the system, enabling you to use the tool in CLI (command line) mode. This avoids having to write any actual code. Instead, it acts more like a program you can execute from the command line.

### üì¶ Project installation (Module usage)

Open up a terminal session in your project folder and execute:
```bash
$ npm install --production responsive-image-builder
```
This installs RIB locally in your project. A decent understanding of JavaScript, Node.js and asynchronous programming is required. If this is not what you want, consider the CLI usage instead.

## Usage

### üåç Global installation (CLI usage)

If you installed the module globally, RIB is available on your system PATH. You may execute it from the terminal or from a batch/bash script.

Usage: `rib [options] -i <input_paths> -o <output_path>`

#### Config

When used as a CLI tool, RIB will search for configuration files with [cosmiconfig](https://github.com/davidtheclark/cosmiconfig) and merge them with provided command line flags. The acceptable ways of providing a config file are:
- a `rib` property in `package.json`
- a `.ribrc`, `.ribrc.json`, `.ribrc.yaml` or `.ribrc.js` file in the project root
- a `rib.config.js` file exporting a config object (CommonJS)

<p align="center"><sub>The configuration file is optional, as almost everything can be done with CLI flags</sub></p>

#### Examples
```bash
$ rib  # Requires a config file somewhere
$ rib -i input -o output
$ rib -i folder1..folder2 -o build
$ rib --no-clean --force --no-webp -i src/img -o dist/img
```

<p align="center"><sub>The syntax is equivalent on Windows, macOS and Linux, however the path system may vary</sub></p><br>

To see all the available options, run `rib --help`.

### üì¶ Project installation (Module usage)

RIB may be imported as an executable function, using the new ES6 import syntax. The function returns a [Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) that resolves into a `Result` object (see [Typescript](#typescript)), and never rejects.

```javascript
// Legacy import
const { responsiveImageBuilder } = require("responsive-image-builder");

// ES Module import (marked as experimental in Node.js docs)
import { responsiveImageBuilder } from "responsive-image-builder";

const config = {
  in: "../in/",
  out: "../out/"
};

// Promise .then usage
responsiveImageBuilder(config)
  .then(result => {
    if (!result.error) {
      console.log("Complete");
    } else {
      console.error("Build failed");
    }
  });

// async/await usage
(async () => {
  const result = await responsiveImageBuilder(config);
  if (!result.error) {
    console.log("Complete");
  } else {
    console.error("Build failed");
  }
})();
```

The `Result` object is defined in the [Typescript](#typescript) typings. It will look something like this:

```typescript
interface Result {
  success: boolean;
  error?: ProgramError;
  exports?: Export[];
}
```

## The Configuration Object

The configuration object is used to tell RIB how it should execute. When used as a module, the config is a Javascript object that is passed as an argument to the main function. When used as a CLI tool, it's a JSON/Javascript object in the config file. The only two required keys are `in` and `out`.

All keys in the configuration object have [Typescript](#typescript) typings that will automatically be picked up by software like VS Code's Intellisense for helpful autocompletion. These provide descriptions of the keys, as well as their accepted types. The config object will also be verified during runtime for inconsistencies.

**Note:** The supported keys for codec specific settings are:
- exportWebp
- resize
- optimize
- [optimizerSettings](#optimization)
- exportPresets

### Export Presets

These describe the resizing pipeline. The `exportPresets` property is an array of ExportPreset objects. Each image will be tested for each exportPreset. The image will only be resized to that preset if its own dimensions fit into the ones specified by the preset and the dimensions have not already been selected for export.

```typescript
interface ExportPreset {
  name: string;      // Name of the export (for the manifest file)
  width: number;     // Maximum width
  height: number;    // Maximum height
  force?: boolean;   // Export even if it means a duplicate
  default?: boolean; // Add "default: true" to the manifest entry
}
```

By default there are 4 presets:

- 16x16 - thumbnail - forced
- 1280x720 - small - forced
- 1920x1080 - normal
- 3840x2160 - large

This means that a large 4K image will have 4 resized exports, while a small avatar may have only 2. This number doubles when exportWebp is enabled.

## Manifest

The manifest file is an extremely useful JSON encoded object that contains information about all of the completed exports. It can be quickly loaded by the client to view a list of available images and sizes, and used to select the best available image and it's corresponding URL.

The structure of the manifest file is available in the [Typescript](#typescript) typings. It looks something like this:

```typescript
interface IManifest {
  exports: IExport[];
}

interface IExport {
  name: string;
  fullName: string;
  extension: string;
  sizes?: IExportSize[];
  webp: boolean;
}

interface IExportSize {
  name: string;
  width: number;
  height: number;
  default?: true;
}
```

Decoding the manifest file can be a little tricky. It's designed to be as compact as possible, making it possible for the client to download the whole image database without a large overhead.

The export `name` property lets you easily find an image in the manifest. It's equal to the basename of the original filename of the image.

The `fullName` property is like the name property, but it instead of just the basename it will also give you the relative directory structure,
which in essence gives you the full resolvable URL location of the image (without the extension). In larger projects, it may be better to resolve
images by `fullName` rather than `name`, guaranteeing uniqueness (not possible to have two files with the same name in the same directory).

Each export can either be a *single* type export, or a *multiple* type export. This depends on the presence of the `sizes` key on the export.

If `sizes` is not present on the export object, the resulting image url will be `export.fullName + export.extension`.

If `sizes` is present, there are multiple exports. Each exportSize object points to one file, constructed as `export.fullName + "_" + exportSize.name + export.extension`.

If `webp` is true, then each image also has a corresponding webP export. For every image path resolved using the methods listed above, the webp can be resolved by suffixing `".webp"` instead of `export.extension` to the end of the path.

#### Example exported file names
```typescript
vector.svg          // the sizes property is not present

picture_small.jpeg  // the export size name is "small"
picture_small.webp  // webp is true (enabled)

banner.png          // webp is false, and sizes is undefined
```

<details><summary>üò¢ Help! I don't understand!</summary>
<p>
Take the following manifest.json file:


```json
{
  "exports": [
    {
      "name": "vector",
      "fullName": "img/vector",
      "extension": ".svg",
      "webp": false
    },
    {
      "name": "picture",
      "fullName": "img/picture",
      "extension": ".jpeg",
      "webp": true,
      "sizes": [
        {
          "name": "small",
          "width": 1280,
          "height": 720
        },
        {
          "name": "large",
          "width": 1920,
          "height": 1080,
          "default": true
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

This simply means that there are 5 exported files under the `img/` folder:

- vector.svg          (could be any size, it doesn't really matter)
- picture_small.jpeg  (1280x720)
- picture_small.webp  (1280x720)
- picture_large.jpeg  (1920x1080)
- picture_large.webp  (1920.1080)

The `webp: true` property meant that each export had a corresponding `.webp` image with the same base name, while the absence of `sizes: [...]` on the vector image means that it only has one export, and doesn't require the underscore naming system.

</p>

## Typescript

In previous versions of RIB I maintained JSON schemas for the configuration objects and program responses. The project has now been rewritten using Typescript, and all the configuration parameters have enforced types and explanations.

Using an editor like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), you can benefit from autocompletion, type-checking, object property hinting and helpful descriptions of config keys and functions as you type.

Even without modern editor, you can consult the generated `*.d.ts` typing files for correct API usage.

## Optimization

Image optimization uses *pngquant*, *mozjpeg*, *svgo* and *gifsicle* to reduce the fallback codec size as much as possible. It's a very aggressive, and also very slow. It's more intensive than the resize process.

You can override all of the optimizer settings by specifying the `optimizerSettings` key in the configuration object (must be under on of the `png`, `jpeg`, `svg` or `gif` keys).

See [imagemin-pngquant](https://www.npmjs.com/package/imagemin-pngquant), [imagemin-mozjpeg](https://www.npmjs.com/package/imagemin-mozjpeg), [imagemin-svgo](https://www.npmjs.com/package/imagemin-svgo) and [imagemin-gifsicle](https://www.npmjs.com/package/imagemin-gifsicle) for the available options.

WebP images are already optimized by the WebP encoder. Using the default settings, both a JPEG and WebP export will have very similar file sizes due to aggressive JPEG compression being applied after conversion. Usually WebP provides a ~40% file reduction, if you want to achieve this then you will have to play around with the JPEG and WebP optimizer settings to get the desired results.

### Performance

RIB has been rewritten from the ground up to be more efficient than previous versions. Instead of writing vast quantities of raw image data to memory buffers for every operation, the new version leverages the performance of Node.js streams, reducing the memory footprint without sacrificing any speed.

For each image job, a tree-like stream network is created that flows data from the source image, through the resize and optimizer streams before being redirected back to the disk. This allows image data to flow through the network as needed until all write streams close, small packets at a time.

On a high-end system, you may expect to process a thousand high-quality 4K images a minute with the default program configuration.

- [ ] Support "synchronize" mode where only missing images are exported
- [ ] Add exportOriginalCodec option
- [ ] Add codec conversion support (e.g. TIFF -> JPEG)
- [ ] Add checksum to manifest for better image searching
- [ ] Add support for imagemin-webp
- [ ] Add example with new WebP optimizer and better optimizer settings
- [ ] Avoid double-compressing a file when optimizer is enabled

### Quirks

 - If non-image files are detected in the output folder, the user is warned and asked to confirm the clean
 - Ctrl+C and interrupt signals are intercepted once, the program will attempt to gracefully close as soon as the current running jobs are complete. A second interrupt will instantly quit the program.
