> **Image Processing Pipeline** is a platform-agnostic  modular collection of packages that aims to glue together various image libraries into and configurable automated pipeline.

### Philosophy

Images make your websites pop, but they are also the largest asset that you serve to your client. Correctly optimising images provides a much better experience, by not wasting your visitors' bandwidth, battery and making the navigation of your website smoother.

At its highest level, Image Processing Pipeline is a command line tool that helps you **automate** your website's image build process in a **non-destructive** way, with **speed** and **quality** in mind. At a lower level, it is a modular set of functions that can be integrated into any existing backend service.

### How it works

Image Processing Pipeline is built on top of three key concepts:

#### üå¥ Pipeline

At the heart is a user-defined **pipeline**. A pipeline is a collection of **pipes** that can be assembled in any tree-like pattern, along with any additional options and an optional **save key** that will mark the pipe's output for export.

#### üî® Pipe

Pipes are **simple asynchronous** functions that take a **source** image and output any number of **formats**. Pipes can apply any transformation to the source image, such as resizing, compressing or converting the image.

#### üîñ Metadata

Every image is accompanied by a **metadata** object, which is a collection of key-value pairs that describe the image. Pipes may modify an image#s metadata object, which can later be used to customise the output filename or to create an image **manifest** file.

### Features

- ‚ö° **Fast** - Uses the amazing libvips image processing library
- üî• **Parallel** - Scales to any amount of available cores
- üíé **Lanczos3** - Quality-first image down-scaling algorithm
- üì¶ **Works out of the box** - Uses a sane default configuration
- üåç **Universal** - Designed to works anywhere without lock-in
- ‚úÇÔ∏è **Cross-platform** - Tested on Windows, macOS and Linux
- üòä **Friendly** - an easy to use CLI experience

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js v10.8 or higher
- npm

### Installation

> It is recommended to install IPP as a dependency of your project, this is just an example to quickly try it out

To give IPP a go on the command line, you will need to install the CLI package:

```bash
$ npm i -g @ipp/cli
```

This will add IPP to your path. Find a folder of images, and give it a go:

```bash
$ ipp -i folder/with/images -o output/folder
```

### Configuration

In order to get the most out of IPP you need to set up a configuration file with all of your persistent values. This can be in your `package.json`, or in a file named `.ipprc`, `.ipprc.yml` or `.ipprc.json`.

Then all you need to do is run `ipp` from the terminal!

<sub>.ipprc.yml</sub>

```yaml
# These will be the folders that will get processed,
# relative to the current working directory
input: folder/with/images
output: folder/with/images

# Remove this part to disable manifest generation
manifest:
  source:
    p: path
    x: "hash:8"
  format:
    w: width
    h: height
    f: format
    p: path
    x: "hash:8"

# Here is where you customise the pipeline
# This is what the default pipeline looks like
pipeline:
  - pipe: resize
    options:
      breakpoints:
        - name: sm
          resizeOptions:
            width: 480
        - name: md
          resizeOptions:
            width: 720
        - name: lg
          resizeOptions:
            width: 1920
        - name: xl
          resizeOptions:
            width: 3840
    save: "[name]-[breakpoint][ext]"
    then:
      - pipe: convert
        options:
          format: webp
        save: "[name]-[breakpoint][ext]"
```
