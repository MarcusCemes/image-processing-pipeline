 *        https://github.com/MarcusCemes/responsive-image-builder
 *
 * This is an Angular (7) service that responds to src/srcset requests.
 * It returns an object which an <img> can bind to (with [src] and [srcset]).
 * When WebP support has been asynchronously detected (or not) with Modernizr,
 * the original objects are updated with src and srcset URLs.
 *
 * ImageService maintains a high-speed cache. Objects for the same requests
 * are shared. Fetching an already resolved image will read the entry
 * already present in cache, and return its shared singleton object.
 *
 * An error is logged in console if an image can not be resolved. The image
 * database is read from the manifest.json file in the image directory.
 *
 * The path to the manifest.json file and the base path for images are
 * hard coded into the four require(...) calls. This is to prevent Webpack
 * from including EVERYTHING in the build. It's not possible to set these
 * at runtime without some extra WebPack logic.
 *
 * Example usage: <img [src]="ImageService.get('image_name').src">
 * This will bind to the property, and resolve the best image as soon
 * as WebP support is decided!
 *
